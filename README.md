Makes names on Honor Bars more legible for those of us with old-people eyes.

## Differences from the original

* Uses [small caps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_caps) so you can see the difference between PEDROXIMENZ and PedroXimenez
* Uses a bigger, more legible basic font, and scales it down when needed
* Removes the hidden overflow, so you don't get "..." instead of usernames
